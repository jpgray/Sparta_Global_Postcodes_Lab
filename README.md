# Sparta_Global_Postcodes_Lab

This was a lab to practice creating a suite of tests for the results received from an API - postcodesio. This API allows you to submit requests for a single or multiple postcodes and will return a JSON file with relevant information. This information was then parsed and tested. to submit the requests, the ruby gem HTTParty was used. Finally, as part of the testing, a second class was created to randomly generate postcodes for use in the tests. This has also been tested in turn.
